\section{Shared weights}
In CNNs, each filter $h_i$ is replicated across the entire visual field. The replicated units
share the same parameterization (weight vector and bias) and form a feature map. Weights of the
weight-shared neurons are guaranteed to be identical. The gradident of a shared weight is simply
the sum of the gradient of the parameters being shared.

Replicating units in this way allow for features to be detected regardless of their position in
the visual field. Additionally, weight sharing increases learning efficiency by reducing the number
of free parameters.
