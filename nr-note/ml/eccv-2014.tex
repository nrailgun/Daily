\title{Facial Landmark Detection}
\maketitle

\section{Abstract}
Facial landmark detection has long been impeded by the problem of occlusion and pose
variation. We investigate the possibility of improving detection robustness through
multitask learning (e.g.head pose estimation and facial attribute inference). We
formulate a novel task-constrained deep model, with task-wise early stopping to facilitate
learning convergence.

\section{Introduction}
Facial landmark detection is a fundamental component in many facial analysis tasks.
