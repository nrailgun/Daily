\title{Bag-of-words model}
\maketitle

\section{Introduction}
The \textbf{Bag-of-words} is a simplifying representation used in NLP and IR. In this model, a
string is represented as a multiset of words (say, bag of words), disregarding grammar and even
word order but multiplicity.

\section{Model}
Let $s$ denotes a text document, $w$ denotes words in $s$:
\begin{equation}
	w_i \in s
\end{equation}

Based on this document, we can construct vector $f$:
\begin{equation}
	f_i = n(w_i);
\end{equation}
where $n(w_i)$ denotes times word $w_i$ appears in $s$. You might consider BoW model as sort of
histogram.
