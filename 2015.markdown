* Try using Hadoop
* Hadoop: The Definitive Guide ?~42, wrote some example codes

## 09.01
* tried using Eclipse to build Hadoop, failed, I hate this idea.
* Watching MOOC ML video chapter 10 & chapter 11

## 09.08
* Reading "Deep Convolutional Network Cascade for Facial Point Detection" for 3 days (2 days actually).
* Working on Caffe to solve this problem for 4+ days. It should not be too hard. however, I suck in C++ and OOP, and the Caffe code seems a little bit overcoupled.
* No, no, no. I need a new plan:
  * Read Caffe tutorials for overview.
  * Understand Caffe code more carefully.
  * Rewrite code, implement cascnn fp.

* After read Caffe `Net`, `Layer`, `DataLayer`, and `LossLayer` **patiently**, I found it not so hard. I started to came up with solutions. Ok, for now.
